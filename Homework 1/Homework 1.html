        Ensuring women's <del>equal</del> participation in policy and decision making is essential if we are to tackle the global crises we face, say <em>Jocalyn Clark</em>  and <em>Roopa Dhatt</em>

        Who could argue with the principle of <strong>gender</strong> <del>equality</del>? Beyond being the right thing to do, gender equality is the smart thing to do. <em>Societies that are more gender equal outperform unequal ones</em>. Gender balanced teams are associated with better decisions and healthcare outcomes and more inclusive and egalitarian leadership.1 But just as we think gender equality has been accepted as routine and non-controversial, agreement evaporates and it has to be argued for all over again.
    </h2>
<p>
    As far back as 1979, with the Convention on the <del>Elimination</del> of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and then in 1995, with the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, governments worldwide agreed to balanced political participation and power sharing between women and men in decision making. In the current context of inter-related and complex global crises—pandemic recovery, unrelenting conflict, economic crises, and the climate emergency—it is more crucial than ever to ensure women and men are equally represented in policy and decision making in health and beyond. Failure to ensure women’s leadership is a failure of the global response.
</p>
<p>
    We can only make sense of the suffering and the losses of global crises—including the pandemic, ongoing conflict, climates emergencies, and economic uncertainties—if we treat these crises as a break in history and change the status quo. In the health sector, women with talent, professional expertise, agency, and experience are everywhere. Women cannot be expected to simply deliver health systems while men make decisions. At the World Health Summit 2022 this week, where we expect gender parity in chairs and moderators, we will argue strongly that meaningful leadership and response to tackling global challenges and paving the way to sustainability depends upon women’s inclusion and gender equity in leadership.
